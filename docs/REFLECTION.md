# Reflections Log


# AI is a very useful tool in programming. There are so many AI tools out there. They will all
# generate very similar things based on what you provide. AI is as good as what you provide.
# Object Oriented Programmming in general is long and time consuming.
# There is easy room for error, and it takes forever to find errors.
# That is what AI can come into play. All the AI strong suit is finding errors, telling you what errors are there, and fixing the error the right ones and apply it to code.
# It saves a lot of time by just fixing code by trial and error. You can also learn something you did not know before.

# The weakness of AI is that it can be literal or provide extraneous information or worse not generate anything at all or takes forever to generate.
# It can provide things you do not want. You have to be detailed in what you want.
# Because AI isnâ€™t perfect you have to use your expert knowledge and trust your instincts on whether or not something that is generated from AI is correct.
# Being detailed is key. You have to provide the correct package, class, and object. Had some errors because of this mistake.

# For using the AI for this project, it generated code and the classes given after giving the information needed for classes, it will ask for you want a code for a testclass then Maven which is aligned with the project.
# I then ran the code and It printed out the Shapes, Length-like radius, base length, surface area and volume. This is where code is tested. It was also accurate with the test class then ran the code and same thing
# I also had to pay attention to the project directory. Where classes are located it is important to prevent errors.
# I also made sure to put the testclass separate package and not in the shapes package.
# AI is great as a tool for learning and asking questions but not depend on it.
# AI existence is just a tool to make anything in life easier.
